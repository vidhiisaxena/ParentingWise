                <p>
                    Newborn care refers to the care provided to a baby from birth until
                    about 28 days of life. This period is critical as newborns undergo significant physiological
                    and
                    other health complications. Proper newborn care ensures that babies have the best possible start in
                    life.
                </p>
                <h2>Key Aspects of Newborn Care:</h2>
                <p>
                    Breastfeeding: Initiating breastfeeding within the first hour of birth provides essential nutrients
                    and antibodies.
                    <br>
                    Keeping the umbilical stump clean and dry to prevent infection.
                    <br>
                    Administering the necessary vaccines to protect against common infectious diseases. Screening for
                    congenital conditions and early detection of any health issues
                    <br>
                    Apgar Score: A quick test performed at 1 and 5 minutes after birth to assess the newborn's physical
                    condition and determine any immediate need for extra medical or emergency care.

                    infants and toddlers. This development is a critical part of a child's early years and sets the

        <p>
            A sleep tracker is crucial for both parents and their newborn baby as it helps monitor and manage sleep
            patterns,
            ensuring both get the rest they need. For newborns, quality sleep is essential for growth, brain
            development, and
            overall health. Tracking sleep can identify issues such as irregular sleep patterns or disturbances,
            enabling
            timely interventions. For parents, especially those adjusting to the demands of caring for a newborn,
            understanding their baby's sleep schedule can help them better plan their rest periods, reducing stress and
            fatigue. Additionally, insights from sleep tracking can aid in establishing healthy sleep routines and
            habits for
            the baby, promoting long-term well-being for both the child and parents.
